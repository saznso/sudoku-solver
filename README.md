# sudoku solver

this is a program that solves any solvable sudoku puzzle. it uses backtracking. essentially it incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution. this is faster and more effiencient than checking every single possible solution one by one. small flaw is that to enter the sudoku to be solved you have to type it into the array. i got tired of it tbh so sorry lol.
